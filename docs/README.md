## Price

The price is $0.75 per egg, and goes to a very worthy cause. We are saving up for an Iron Man suit and a pony.


## Delivery

There are two delivery options:

 * For the small fee of $1/delivery, we can bring the eggs around to your house after school. Gledden St and Welsh Place only. Cash on delivery, please have correct change.
 * You can collect the eggs from the front porch at no. 20, and leave the payment in our honesty-box.
