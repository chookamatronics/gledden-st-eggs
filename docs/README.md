# Hello and Welcome :)

This is how it works:

 * [Sign up to our newsletter](http://eepurl.com/c6B-oP)
 * We will use this to let you know when there are fresh eggs for sale
 * Tell us you want some, and we will bring them to you

## Price

The price is $0.75/egg, and goes to a very worthy cause. We are saving up for an Iron Man suit and a pony.


## Delivery

There are two delivery options:

 * For the small fee of $1/delivery, we can bring the eggs around to your house after school. Gledden St and Welsh Place only. Cash on delivery, please have correct change.
 * You can collect the eggs from the front porch at no. 20, and leave the payment in our honesty-box.


## Cartons

Out happy hens make a lot of eggs, and we need recycled cartons to put them in. It would help us a lot if you gave us an empty carton when we give you one with eggs in it. If you have spare cartons that you would like to recycle, you can give them to us. 


## Feedback

We are happy to get any feedback from you, we would like to know if you think the prices are too high and tell us what they should be, or maybe you would like to tell us how good our eggs are. If you do have any criticism, please tell it to us constructivley, because then we can turn that constructive critisism into actual stuff that you suggested to us. 

Thanks!
