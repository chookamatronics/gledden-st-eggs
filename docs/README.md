# Hello and Welcome :)

This is how it works:

 * Sign up to our newsletter
 * we will let you know when there are fresh spare eggs for sale
 * tell us you want some and we will bring them round to you
 
 The price is $1/egg, we can do after school deliveries or we can leave them on the front porch at no. 20 Gledden street.
 If you want the delivery to your house you will need to pay a $! extra fee. 
 
 We would love to get some feedback from you about anything, from  prices, how the chooks are and how we got a chicken on the sign-post to take that amazing picture unerneath all this writing.
 Please share this web site with friends and/or family because our chickens are laying somany eggs we have no idea what to do with them. Thanks!!
